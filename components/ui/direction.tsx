/**
 * # Direction
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 * This file helps run the simulator experience and shows the controls and results people use to test scenarios.
 *
 * ## What it does
 * - Helps the app show the right page, section, or feature.
 * - Accepts or sends data needed by the rest of the app.
 * - Keeps the code organized so it is easier to understand and update.
 *
 * ## Main pieces in this file
 * - `DirectionProvider`: the main thing this file provides to the app.
 * - Other small helper functions or values support that main work.
 *
 * ## Important tools and connections
 * - Uses project code and libraries that help the app run smoothly.
 * - Works with the rest of the simulator, dashboard, or UI layers.
 *
 * ## How data moves through it
 * Data usually comes in from a user action or from another part of the app. This file reads that information, applies the needed logic, and then sends it on or displays it on screen.
 *
 * ## Errors and edge cases
 * The code checks for missing, unusual, or invalid values and tries to handle them safely. If something is not valid, it usually falls back to a safe default or prevents the bad input from continuing.
 *
 * ## How it fits into the app
 * This file is one small part of the larger system. It connects to other sections so the app feels like one working tool instead of separate pieces.
 *
 * ## Helpful notes
 * The goal here is to keep the code simple, clear, and easy to maintain without changing how the app behaves.
